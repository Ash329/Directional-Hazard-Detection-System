# Directional Hazard Detection System

An accessibility-focused computer-vision web app that helps visually impaired users detect hazards in real time. The user opens the site on a phone, grants camera access, and the app speaks directional alerts — *"Car ahead"*, *"Person on the left"* — as objects appear in the camera feed.

The app is a Flask backend, a mobile-first vanilla-JS frontend, and a pretrained Ultralytics **YOLOv8** detector. It is packaged as an installable Progressive Web App (PWA) so it can be added to a phone's home screen and
launched like a native app.

## How it works

Every ~1 second while the camera is live:

1. **Browser** — captures a frame from the video element into a hidden canvas and encodes it as a JPEG data URL.
2. **Backend** — `POST /api/live-detect` decodes the frame and runs YOLOv8 (`yolov8n.pt`) via the `ObjectDetector` class.
3. **Direction logic** — each detection's bounding-box center is bucketed into
   *left / center / right* thirds of the frame. Detections are prioritized by
   hazard class (person, car, bicycle, …) then by bounding-box area.
4. **Response** — JSON payload with `summary_text`, `primary_direction`,
   `has_hazard`, and the top detections.
5. **Frontend** — draws colored bounding boxes over the live video and, when
   `has_hazard` is true, speaks the summary via the browser's
   `SpeechSynthesis` API. When the path is clear the app stays silent.

## Tech stack

- **Backend:** Python 3, Flask, OpenCV, Ultralytics YOLOv8 (`yolov8n.pt`)
- **Frontend:** HTML, Tailwind (via CDN), vanilla JS, Canvas 2D overlay
- **Audio:** browser-native `SpeechSynthesis` (no cloud TTS)
- **PWA:** `manifest.webmanifest`, service worker with offline app-shell cache,
  maskable icons, iOS meta tags

## Deployment

The app is deployed as a **Docker Space on Hugging Face Spaces** (CPU Basic tier, free, 16 GB RAM). Everything the Space needs lives in this repo. The link is https://mohabs3-directional-hazard-detection.hf.space.
